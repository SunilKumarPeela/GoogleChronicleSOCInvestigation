![Chronicle19](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/chronicle19.png)   
Here, Chronicle automatically mapped the case to **MITRE ATT&CK T1204.002 – User Execution (Malicious File)**.  
- The domain **`manygoodnews.com`** was confirmed as contacted during execution.  
- Chronicle displayed **3 suggested mitigations**, including **User Training (M1017)**, to reduce recurrence.  

This step established **tactical context** — proving that the infection occurred via **user-triggered macro execution**.

---

### 🧬 Step 10: Threat Intelligence Enrichment (VirusTotal)  
![Chronicle13](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/chronicle18.png)  
The **VT Augment** widget revealed the malicious file from the suspicious domain.  
- **48/69 security vendors** flagged it as **malicious**.  
- File type: `Win32 EXE`, size: **385 KB**, flagged under **Trojan.Loader** category.  
This correlation verified that the **downloaded payload** was already recognized across major vendors — confirming **high confidence** in the detection.

---

### 🧰 Step 11: Mandiant Intelligence Correlation  
![Chronicles14](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/chronicle17.png)  
Cross-referencing with **Mandiant Threat Intelligence**, the domain `manygoodnews.com` was rated with a **score of 100** and had links to historical ransomware activity.  
While not directly attributing, the indicators matched profiles related to **Windows-based loaders** with **anti-VM and memory allocation evasion**.  
This suggested the macro chain was possibly delivering a **commodity loader** from known ransomware infrastructure.

---

### 🔄 Step 12: Similar Cases & Entity Correlation  
![Chronicle15](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle16.png)  
I examined **Similar Cases** in Chronicle SOAR.  
Multiple prior incidents had identical **entity matches** (`208.91.197.46`, `manygoodnews.com`) and **MITRE T1204.002** correlation.  
The majority were labeled **Critical**, confirming a **recurring attack pattern** in the organization.  

This validated that our **detection rule** was effectively catching repeat infections of the same malware variant.

---

### ⚙️ Step 13: Reviewing the Malware Detection Playbook  
![Chronicle16](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle15.png)

---

### 🧩 Step 17: Endpoint-Level Forensics (UDM Query View)  
![Chronicle20](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle11.png)  
Finally, I executed a **UDM Query** for process and DNS artifacts.  
- Hostname: `mikeross-pc`  
- Event: `PROCESS_START` + `DnsRequest`  
- Source: **CrowdStrike Falcon**  
This indicated that **another internal endpoint** communicated with the same malicious domain — proof of **lateral exposure**.  

---
## ⚡ Phase 3 — Endpoint Telemetry & Final Correlation in Google Chronicle  

After confirming cross-host involvement, I pivoted deeper into **endpoint telemetry** to trace the **execution chain** that initiated the macro-based infection.

---

### 🧩 Step 18: Process Chain Validation — Outlook → Excel Execution  
![Chronicle21](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle21.png)  
This log shows **Outlook.exe launching Excel.exe** on **`mikeross-pc`**, a classic indicator of a **malicious email attachment executing a macro payload**.  
The process was flagged by **CrowdStrike Falcon** and linked to downloads from **`manygoodnews.com`**, confirming a **suspicious Office-based infection chain**.

And then moved to the Chronicle case graph which shows the full infection path — manygoodnews.com hosted the malicious file Client%20Update.exe, downloaded on mikeross-pc via Outlook-triggered Excel execution.

![Chronicle22](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/chronicle22.png)  

And It shows both alerts marked Critical (Risk Score 95), confirming a coordinated malware download detected under the “suspicious_download_office” rule.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle28.png)  

The **pivot results** revealed identical **HTTP alert events** from both `mikeross-pc` and `steve-watson-pc`, each receiving data packets of **514,605 bytes**, suggesting consistent payload size. 

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle29.png)  

In the **Alerts tab**, a single high-risk event titled *“suspicious_download_office”* was flagged with a **risk score of 95 (Critical)**, confirming active communication with `manygoodnews.com`.  
This consolidated evidence verified that both endpoints were participating in **the same malicious download session**, reinforcing the **macro-based data exfiltration attempt**.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle30.png)  

### 🧩 Step 21: Detection Overview — Confirming Consistent Macro-Based Triggers  
The **Detection Dashboard** shows multiple alerts under the rule *“suspicious_download_office”* triggered on both `mikeross-pc` and `steve-watson-pc`.  
Each event logs **Excel.exe launching via Outlook** followed by an **HTTP request to manygoodnews.com**, confirming repeated macro-triggered download attempts across endpoints.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle35.png)  

## 🚨 Phase 3: Threat Rule Validation and Cross-System Correlation  

In **Phase 3**, the investigation transitioned from endpoint-level evidence to rule-level intelligence validation — confirming how the attack pattern was identified, triggered, and correlated across multiple telemetry sources within Google Chronicle.  

---

### 🧠 Step 22: Deep Process Telemetry — Verifying Execution and Payload Source  
The **Process_Launch log** from Tanium Stream confirms that **Excel.exe** was executed by **Outlook.exe** on both `steve-watson-pc` and `mikeross-pc`, sharing the same **parent PID (22895)**.  
The telemetry shows identical **file paths** and **MD5 hashes**, proving both systems executed the same malicious Office payload.  

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle36.png)  

This consistent process linkage validates that the macro-based infection originated from a **common Outlook-delivered Excel attachment**.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle37.png) 

### ⚙️ Step 23: Rule Validation and Logic Confirmation  

the **“suspicious_download_office”** detection rule was reviewed and validated within Google Chronicle’s **Rules & Detections** panel.  
The rule, authored by *Google Cloud Security*, is configured as **Critical severity** and set to trigger on **multiple correlated events** combining both **PROCESS_LAUNCH** and **NETWORK_HTTP** telemetry.
