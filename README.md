![Chronicle4](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle4.png)  
Within the **Case Wall**, I documented my findings, escalated the case priority to *Critical*, and created a new task titled **‚ÄúFix SLA‚Äù**.  
This ensured the response time remained within service-level targets and added accountability by assigning it directly to the SOC administrator.

---

### üåê Step 4: Entity Correlation ‚Äî Uncovering the Full Picture  
![Chronicle5](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/chronicle5.png)  
Using Chronicle‚Äôs **Entity Highlights**, I identified 15 entities linked to this case:
- User: `STEVE-WATSON`  
- Host: `STEVE-WATSON-PC`  
- Internal IPs: `10.205.11.20`, `10.205.11.2`  
- MITRE Technique: `T1204.002`  
- Domain: `manygoodnews.com`  
- Process ID: `22895`  

The repeated appearance of the same user, host, and IP combination confirmed this was not an isolated alert, but a **persistent infection** attempt.

---

### üß† Step 5: Visualizing the Attack Chain  
![Chronicle6](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle6.png)  
![Chronicle7](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle7.png)  
I visualized the incident in Chronicle‚Äôs **Case Graph**, which clearly mapped the entire infection chain:
Red nodes marked confirmed malicious indicators.  
Multiple connections from different hosts validated that the attack was **spreading via shared macro-laced documents**.

---

### üéØ Step 6: Target Entities and Response Options  
![Chronicle8](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle8.png)  
Chronicle presented **Target Entities** (user, host, IPs, and domains) alongside **Response Options** such as:
- Deep investigation of host telemetry  
- Escalation to SOC Manager  
- Customer environment notification  

This step helped me align the immediate containment actions with escalation workflows.

---

### üß© Step 7: Validating Process and DNS Artifacts  
![Chronicle9](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle9.png)  
![Chronicle10](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle10.png)  
To confirm the scope, I reviewed **CrowdStrike Falcon** and **UDM** telemetry.  
Logs verified a **process start event** on `STEVE-WATSON-PC` and **five DNS requests** to `manygoodnews.com`.  
Interestingly, a second host, `mikeross-pc`, exhibited identical behavior, indicating lateral movement of the same macro payload.

---

## üß† Phase 2 ‚Äî Deep Investigation, Threat Intelligence & SOAR Automation  


After identifying the **Suspicious Macro Activity**, I continued my investigation within **Google Chronicle**, diving deeper into rule-based events, threat intelligence feeds, and automation flows to confirm and mitigate the threat.

---

### üß© Step 8: Correlated Events and Rule Validation  
![Chronicle11](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle12.png)  
I opened the **Events tab** of the case `suspicious_download_office`. Two correlated rule events stood out:  
- **NETWORK_HTTP** ‚Äî A malicious outbound connection.  
- **PROCESS_LAUNCH** ‚Äî Execution of `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\Excel.exe`.  

Both were generated under the **RULE** source, confirming Chronicle detected not just a single anomaly but a **multi-vector correlation** between process execution and suspicious web activity.  
From the context menu, I reviewed **‚ÄúManage Alert Detection Rule‚Äù** to verify detection logic and thresholds.

![Chronicle20](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/chronicle20.png)  

---

### üåê Step 9: MITRE Technique & Domain Association  
![Chronicle19](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/chronicle19.png)   
Here, Chronicle automatically mapped the case to **MITRE ATT&CK T1204.002 ‚Äì User Execution (Malicious File)**.  
- The domain **`manygoodnews.com`** was confirmed as contacted during execution.  
- Chronicle displayed **3 suggested mitigations**, including **User Training (M1017)**, to reduce recurrence.  

This step established **tactical context** ‚Äî proving that the infection occurred via **user-triggered macro execution**.

---

### üß¨ Step 10: Threat Intelligence Enrichment (VirusTotal)  
![Chronicle13](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/chronicle18.png)  
The **VT Augment** widget revealed the malicious file from the suspicious domain.  
- **48/69 security vendors** flagged it as **malicious**.  
- File type: `Win32 EXE`, size: **385 KB**, flagged under **Trojan.Loader** category.  
This correlation verified that the **downloaded payload** was already recognized across major vendors ‚Äî confirming **high confidence** in the detection.

---

### üß∞ Step 11: Mandiant Intelligence Correlation  
![Chronicles14](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/chronicle17.png)  
Cross-referencing with **Mandiant Threat Intelligence**, the domain `manygoodnews.com` was rated with a **score of 100** and had links to historical ransomware activity.  
While not directly attributing, the indicators matched profiles related to **Windows-based loaders** with **anti-VM and memory allocation evasion**.  
This suggested the macro chain was possibly delivering a **commodity loader** from known ransomware infrastructure.

---

### üîÑ Step 12: Similar Cases & Entity Correlation  
![Chronicle15](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle16.png)  
I examined **Similar Cases** in Chronicle SOAR.  
Multiple prior incidents had identical **entity matches** (`208.91.197.46`, `manygoodnews.com`) and **MITRE T1204.002** correlation.  
The majority were labeled **Critical**, confirming a **recurring attack pattern** in the organization.  

This validated that our **detection rule** was effectively catching repeat infections of the same malware variant.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 13: Reviewing the Malware Detection Playbook  
![Chronicle16](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle15.png)  
I analyzed the **SOAR playbook** linked to the case ‚Äî ‚ÄúMalware Detection.‚Äù  
It automated:
- Indicator enrichment via **VirusTotal & Mandiant APIs**  
- Artifact isolation  
- EDR containment triggers  
- Ticket escalation to SOC L2  

This workflow ensured **repeatable, low-latency containment** whenever similar detections arise.

---

### üß≠ Step 14: Event Mapping & Entity Extraction  
![Chronicle17](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicles14.png)  
In **Event Configuration ‚Üí Ontology Mapping**, I validated that Chronicle correctly parsed entity relationships:
- **SourceUserName**, **SourceAddress**, and **DestinationDomain** were correctly extracted from UDM events.  
This confirmed our **rule visualization** aligned with Chronicle‚Äôs **entity graph**, ensuring process and network links were rendered accurately.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Step 15: Event Timeline Reconstruction  
![Chronicle18](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle13.png)  
The **event timeline** displayed simultaneous hits:
- **PROCESS_LAUNCH** and **NETWORK_HTTP**  
Both referenced artifacts tied to `C:\PROGRAM FILES\MICROSOFT OFFICE\OFFICE16\EXCEL.EXE`, pinpointing that **Excel triggered network traffic** within seconds of launch.  
This timing validated the **macro execution sequence**.

---

### üìë Step 16: Compact Correlation Summary  
![Chronicle19](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle12.png)  
In the **Compact Event View**, both process and network detections were grouped.  
This simplified visualization confirmed the **rule correlation** consistency ‚Äî Chronicle‚Äôs logic was performing as intended across all ingestion windows.

---

### üß© Step 17: Endpoint-Level Forensics (UDM Query View)  
![Chronicle20](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle11.png)  
Finally, I executed a **UDM Query** for process and DNS artifacts.  
- Hostname: `mikeross-pc`  
- Event: `PROCESS_START` + `DnsRequest`  
- Source: **CrowdStrike Falcon**  
This indicated that **another internal endpoint** communicated with the same malicious domain ‚Äî proof of **lateral exposure**.  

---
## ‚ö° Phase 3 ‚Äî Endpoint Telemetry & Final Correlation in Google Chronicle  

After confirming cross-host involvement, I pivoted deeper into **endpoint telemetry** to trace the **execution chain** that initiated the macro-based infection.

---

### üß© Step 18: Process Chain Validation ‚Äî Outlook ‚Üí Excel Execution  
![Chronicle21](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle21.png)  
This log shows **Outlook.exe launching Excel.exe** on **`mikeross-pc`**, a classic indicator of a **malicious email attachment executing a macro payload**.  
The process was flagged by **CrowdStrike Falcon** and linked to downloads from **`manygoodnews.com`**, confirming a **suspicious Office-based infection chain**.

And then moved to the Chronicle case graph which shows the full infection path ‚Äî manygoodnews.com hosted the malicious file Client%20Update.exe, downloaded on mikeross-pc via Outlook-triggered Excel execution.

![Chronicle22](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/chronicle22.png)  

And It shows both alerts marked Critical (Risk Score 95), confirming a coordinated malware download detected under the ‚Äúsuspicious_download_office‚Äù rule.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/chronicle23.png)  

---
### üß† Step 19: Domain Investigation ‚Äî Chronicle SIEM Lookup on `manygoodnews.com`  

Next, I pivoted into **Google Chronicle‚Äôs SIEM search** to investigate the domain `manygoodnews.com`.  
The lookup revealed it was registered in Japan under **GMO Internet Group**, linked to multiple alerts and flagged in **VirusTotal (10/88 detections)** ‚Äî confirming it as a **known malicious host** used in the infection chain.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle24.png)  

### üß© Step 19: Network Correlation ‚Äî UDM Query and Cross-Host Activity Validation  

After confirming the domain‚Äôs malicious background, I ran a UDM search query in Chronicle to correlate network events tied to manygoodnews.com.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle25.png)  

The results showed multiple HTTP and DNS alerts from both mikeross-pc and steve-watson-pc, each downloading files around 514,605 bytes, indicating identical payloads.
Chronicle‚Äôs pivot and event viewer confirmed synchronized activity across both hosts, proving coordinated infection timing.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle26.png)  

This correlation validated that the same macro-triggered malware spread through shared Office attachments within the network.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle27.png)  

### üß† Step 20: Pivot Analysis & Alert Verification ‚Äî Confirming Data Exfiltration Behavior  
To validate the infection‚Äôs impact, I performed a **pivot analysis** in Chronicle, grouping results by hostname, user, and network activity fields.  

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle28.png)  

The **pivot results** revealed identical **HTTP alert events** from both `mikeross-pc` and `steve-watson-pc`, each receiving data packets of **514,605 bytes**, suggesting consistent payload size. 

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle29.png)  

In the **Alerts tab**, a single high-risk event titled *‚Äúsuspicious_download_office‚Äù* was flagged with a **risk score of 95 (Critical)**, confirming active communication with `manygoodnews.com`.  
This consolidated evidence verified that both endpoints were participating in **the same malicious download session**, reinforcing the **macro-based data exfiltration attempt**.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle30.png)  

### üß© Step 21: Detection Overview ‚Äî Confirming Consistent Macro-Based Triggers  
The **Detection Dashboard** shows multiple alerts under the rule *‚Äúsuspicious_download_office‚Äù* triggered on both `mikeross-pc` and `steve-watson-pc`.  
Each event logs **Excel.exe launching via Outlook** followed by an **HTTP request to manygoodnews.com**, confirming repeated macro-triggered download attempts across endpoints.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle35.png)  

## üö® Phase 4: Threat Rule Validation and Cross-System Correlation  

In **Phase 3**, the investigation transitioned from endpoint-level evidence to rule-level intelligence validation ‚Äî confirming how the attack pattern was identified, triggered, and correlated across multiple telemetry sources within Google Chronicle.  

---

### üß† Step 22: Deep Process Telemetry ‚Äî Verifying Execution and Payload Source  
The **Process_Launch log** from Tanium Stream confirms that **Excel.exe** was executed by **Outlook.exe** on both `steve-watson-pc` and `mikeross-pc`, sharing the same **parent PID (22895)**.  
The telemetry shows identical **file paths** and **MD5 hashes**, proving both systems executed the same malicious Office payload.  

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle36.png)  

This consistent process linkage validates that the macro-based infection originated from a **common Outlook-delivered Excel attachment**.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle37.png) 

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 23: Rule Validation and Logic Confirmation  

the **‚Äúsuspicious_download_office‚Äù** detection rule was reviewed and validated within Google Chronicle‚Äôs **Rules & Detections** panel.  
The rule, authored by *Google Cloud Security*, is configured as **Critical severity** and set to trigger on **multiple correlated events** combining both **PROCESS_LAUNCH** and **NETWORK_HTTP** telemetry.  

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle38.png) 

It specifically detects Office applications downloading executable files (`.exe`) or unusually large payloads (>100KB), matching **MITRE ATT&CK technique T1204.001 ‚Äî User Execution: Malicious Link**.  

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle39.png) 

YARA-L **Retrohunt** runs confirmed its accuracy across historical data with no false positives.  
This validation ensured the rule effectively captures malicious macro download chains in real time, providing high-confidence detection and automated alerting for similar future threats.

![Chronicle23](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle40.png) 

## üåç Phase 5: SIEM Dashboard Correlation and Post-Incident Analytics  

In **Phase 4**, the investigation advanced into **SOC-level visualization and cross-environment analytics**, leveraging Chronicle‚Äôs SIEM dashboards to confirm the organization‚Äôs detection health, log integrity, and correlated threat visibility after the macro-based compromise.  

---

### üåê Step 24: SIEM Dashboard Correlation ‚Äî Post-Incident Visibility  
The Chronicle **SIEM Dashboards** provided end-to-end operational insight linking directly to the earlier *suspicious_download_office* incident.  
The **Data Ingestion and Health** dashboard verified smooth telemetry flow from diverse log sources ‚Äî including **WinEventLog**, **Sysmon**, **PowerShell**, and **AWS CloudTrail** ‚Äî with **zero ingestion errors** and over **108K normalized events**, confirming that all relevant data for forensic validation was captured accurately.  

![Chronicle41](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle41.png)  

The **Context-Aware Detections ‚Äì Risk** dashboard surfaced the same compromised entities ‚Äî `steve-watson-pc`, `mikeross-pc`, and `manygoodnews.com` ‚Äî now marked under **Critical Risk**, proving the Chronicle rule maintained continuous correlation and risk scoring across the event lifecycle.  

![Chronicle42](https://github.com/SunilKumarPeela/cyberimages/blob/main/Chronicle42.png)
Finally, the **Global IOC Threat Map** reflected a surge in alerts (**734 total**, +716 from baseline) and elevated ingestion throughput (**0.2 GB processed**), visually confirming active monitoring of related malicious IPs worldwide.  
This panoramic SOC-level visibility validated that all detections, telemetry, and IOC activity remained synchronized and transparent across Chronicle‚Äôs analytics layers ‚Äî completing the full incident correlation chain from detection to organizational awareness.
