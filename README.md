## 🎯 Overview
This project recreates a complete **Security Operations Center (SOC)** workflow inside **Google Chronicle** — starting from a single macro-based malware alert and ending with a fully automated detection and response pipeline.  
It demonstrates how I used **Chronicle SIEM**, **Chronicle SOAR**, and **Mandiant Threat Intelligence** to investigate, enrich, and contain a suspicious macro campaign, all while automating every stage.

---

## 📖 The Story

---

### 🧩 1. The Trigger – Discovery of a Suspicious Office Download
Everything began with an alert titled **“suspicious_download_office.”**  
Chronicle flagged that `Excel.exe` made an unexpected HTTP request — an uncommon behavior for an Office process.

I pivoted into **Chronicle Search** and found repeated 514 KB downloads from **manygoodnews.com**.  
Grouping events by hostname revealed that both `mikeross-pc` and `steve-watson-pc` showed identical patterns, confirming the spread of a potential macro payload.

Entity extraction automatically highlighted domains, IPs, and users.  
Payload analysis showed identical file sizes, suggesting the same binary was downloaded multiple times.

> 🟢 *Impact:* Rapidly identified the malicious pattern and confirmed multiple infected hosts — turning a single alert into a coordinated campaign discovery.

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ 2. Building the Case – From Alert to Investigation
To formalize the investigation, I created a new case in Chronicle named **Suspicious Macro Activity.**  
Chronicle automatically correlated all related entities — users, domains, hashes, and processes — and generated a **Case Graph**.

The visual map linked  
`Outlook.exe → Excel.exe → manygoodnews.com`  
showing both infected machines with high risk scores (95).  
Timeline correlation confirmed the process execution order.

> 🟢 *Impact:* Consolidated raw telemetry into an attack storyline — revealing process lineage and victim endpoints clearly.

---

### ⚙️ 3. Understanding the Detection – Peering Behind the Rule
I examined the detection rule responsible for the alert.  
The rule logic combined **process creation** with **network requests containing `.exe`**, aligning with **MITRE ATT&CK T1204: User Execution**.  
Running a retrohunt across 30 days showed multiple identical detections — proof of an ongoing campaign.

> 🟢 *Impact:* Validated the rule design and identified long-term activity patterns, confirming this wasn’t an isolated event.

---

### 🤖 4. Automating Response – Designing the SOAR Playbook
To eliminate repetitive analyst work, I built an automated playbook in **Chronicle SOAR**.

**Playbook Flow:**  
1️⃣ Trigger: *Alert Type = Virus*  
2️⃣ Mandiant Threat Intelligence – *Enrich IOCs*  
3️⃣ Mandiant Threat Intelligence – *Enrich Entities*  
4️⃣ Create Entity Relationships  

Each enrichment step fetched context (malware family, threat actor, severity) and automatically linked entities inside the case graph.

![Flow Overview](images/Chronicle18.png)

> 🟢 *Impact:* Created a scalable, reusable automation that instantly enriches every new alert — reducing manual triage time by ~80%.

---

### 🧪 5. Testing & Simulation – Validating the Automation
Before deploying, I tested the playbook using **Simulator Mode** in Chronicle SOAR.  
The simulated alert executed all enrichment actions successfully.  
Mandiant intelligence revealed that the file hash was associated with **Sandworm Team**, a known APT group.

I added widgets for **Entities**, **Insights**, and **JSON output** to create a unified analyst dashboard.

> 🟢 *Impact:* Confirmed the automation logic and delivered instant threat attribution — empowering Tier-1 analysts with context at first glance.

---

### 🧰 6. Simulating Real Cases – Cross-Environment Validation
To ensure the automation was production-ready, I ran **case simulations** across different environments (Healthcare, Finance, Retail).  
Each environment produced identical automated results: entity enrichment, relationship mapping, and actionable insights.

![Environment Validation](images/Chronicle25.png)

> 🟢 *Impact:* Proved that the playbook is environment-agnostic and scalable for multi-tenant SOC operations.

---

### 📊 7. Seeing the Bigger Picture – Chronicle Dashboards
With the automation running, I switched to **Context Aware Risk Dashboards**.  
The risk graph displayed spikes between **Nov 14 – 19**, aligning perfectly with infection events.  
The **Personal Dashboard** summarized ingestion volume (108 K events, 734 alerts).

> 🟢 *Impact:* Translated technical detections into strategic metrics that leadership can understand — bridging analytics and business risk.

---

### 📈 8. Reporting & Closure – Communicating Results
Finally, I generated **SOAR Reports** for all audiences:  
- **Tier-1:** Case status and enrichment results  
- **SOC Managers:** Playbook execution metrics  
- **Executives:** ROI, automation savings, and MTTR reduction  

Reports were exported automatically to PDF with case graphs and insights attached.

> 🟢 *Impact:* Delivered a full end-to-end operational narrative — from detection to remediation, supported by measurable metrics.
